############## Stack Trace ################

A stack trace is a list of the method calls that an application
was in the middle of when an exception was thrown.

"A stack trace is a report that provides information about program subroutines.
It is commonly used for certain kinds of debugging, where a stack trace can help
software engineers figure out where a problem lies or how various subroutines
work together during execution."

############## feature test ###############

A software feature is something that adds functionality or modifies functionality.
A feature test is a test set that tests the features according to what is required
for that softwares release.

Effective feature tests require an intimate understanding or specification of the feature.
Features tests should exclusively test that particular feature of the program.
Feature tests should cover positive, negative and boundary/edge cases.
Feature tests should be conducted from the beginning.
